Jota: Jon's Offense of The Ancients
================================

Jota is, currently, a simple MOBA (Multi-player Online Battle Arena) like DotA or LoL.
Here are the features of Jota that currently set it apart from such games:

- Unique mana system.  Rather than each player having a pool of mana that they can use, the mana that players needs comes in three different colors (red, green, blue) and is spread out over the map.  When players use abilities they will use nearby mana, which will be gradually replenished.  This means several things:
  1. Players cannot stay still, they have to keep moving if they want to keep using abilities.
  2. You and your teammates will need to coordinate so as to not be trying to use the same mana.  One easy way to do this is to make sure each player wants specifically a different color of mana.
  3. There are abilities that destroy mana, these can be both offensive or defensive depending on the situation.
- Controllers.  We'll see what happens, but right now Jota is being designed with a console experience in mind, and that means controllers.  There are keyboard bindings but they are much more difficult to use than the controller bindings.
- Friendly fire is always on.  I don't know why other mobas allow a nuclear bomb to go off and hurt only enemies, but that's not how things work in Jota.  If you nuke an area, you nuke your enemies and teammates alike.  This applies to debuffs, buffs, etc...  There may be some exceptions to this rule but they will probably be unusual and powerful.

Here are planned features that also set it apart from other Mobas:
- A variety of different maps, rather than typical mobas which have 1, or just a very few.
- Standard game mode is point capture, similar to dominion in LoL, but the capturing works more like capturing in UT2k4 Onslaught.
- Less down time.  I'm hoping that you choose a character which comes with certain abilities, but you also have a ship which is where you stats (health, speed, etc...) come from.  You will be able to have multiple ships so that if one gets destroyed, instead of waiting for respawn you can use the other ship while your primary ship is being repaired.
