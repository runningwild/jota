Magnus (TODO: get a better name)
================================

Magnus, sometimes known as Doom, The Board Game: The Computer Game, pits a team, called The Invaders,
against a single person, the Architect.  The Invaders are playing a dungeon crawler, search from the
exit from the dungeon, and the Architect is trying to stop them.  The Architect is able to modify the
level, by placing/removing walls, lava, traps, and enemies, so long as the Invaders are unable to see
what he is modifying.

TODO:
- Fix CGF so that the game ending doesn't crash everything.
- Starting screen, choose to host/join, select side.
- Better random level generator.
- Support windows.
