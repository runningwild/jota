- Make the ai api a little more powerful.
- Camera should track only the primary character, perhaps a ghost cam on death.
- Fix shaders on ATI cards.
- Controller support on windows and linux.
- Allow local movement for better user experience.
- Emailing bug reports should just be handled by a single service, no emails
  required, except maybe to report previously unseen crashes.  - TRIED THIS, not
  great so far, disable it for now.
- Once glop stuff is all stubbed out make a server binary that can be run anywhere.
- Instead of shadows being black they should show a greyed out version of the map, with no entities.

Theoretically fixed, still need verification:
- Change how sys.Think() works on windows to avoid the need for two branches.
  Glop was changed to make sys.Think() run its logic on the render thread when
  on windows, hopefully that eliminates the need to do anything weird in jota.

Fixed:
- Make the los cache an lru cache to reduce memory usage. <- This was fixed by
  just doing the los texture different, basically just on the graphics card.
- The vast majority of cpu time is spent doing los calculations.  Consider rendering
  the los texture as infinitely tall columns from a viewpoint that looks directly down
  onto the player.  There would need to be a way to combine this with other player's
  los, but it would put all of this work onto the graphics card and it would look a lot cleaner.
