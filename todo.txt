- Abilities have tons of non-exported fields, but they have to be exported if
  we want someone to be able to rejoin the game while it's going.
- Ability Draw (and maybe other Draw methods) should take the relevant local data
  so that it can draw properly depending on what side you're on.
- Need separate creeps for each color.
- Fix wall cache - currently ExistsLos checks every segment.
- Make Utility abilities - Nitro, Cloak, Shield - One for each color.  Press a button
  to turn them on, use the trigger to keep them on.  Bonus: Let players choose a single
  utility ability when the game starts.
- Serious optimizations are needed, the game sucks up 500% cpu and runs OOM.
- Make the ai api a little more powerful.
- Fix shaders on ATI cards.
- Controller support on windows and linux.
- Allow local movement for better user experience.
- Emailing bug reports should just be handled by a single service, no emails
  required, except maybe to report previously unseen crashes.  - TRIED THIS, not
  great so far, disable it for now.
- Once glop stuff is all stubbed out make a server binary that can be run anywhere.
- Instead of shadows being black they should show a greyed out version of the map, with no entities.

Theoretically fixed, still need verification:
- Change how sys.Think() works on windows to avoid the need for two branches.
  Glop was changed to make sys.Think() run its logic on the render thread when
  on windows, hopefully that eliminates the need to do anything weird in jota.

Fixed:
