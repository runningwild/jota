- Fix shaders on ATI cards.
- Change how sys.Think() works on windows to avoid the need for two branches.
- Make the los cache an lru cache to reduce memory usage.
- Controller support on windows and linux.
- Send email on crash if caught by the stack catcher.
- Allow local movement for better user experience.
- The vast majority of cpu time is spent doing los calculations.  Consider rendering
  the los texture as infinitely tall columns from a viewpoint that looks directly down
  onto the player.  There would need to be a way to combine this with other player's
  los, but it would put all of this work onto the graphics card and it would look a lot
  cleaner.
