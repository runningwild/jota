- Fix shaders on ATI cards.
- Make the los cache an lru cache to reduce memory usage.
- Controller support on windows and linux.
- Send email on crash if caught by the stack catcher.
- Allow local movement for better user experience.
- The vast majority of cpu time is spent doing los calculations.  Consider rendering
  the los texture as infinitely tall columns from a viewpoint that looks directly down
  onto the player.  There would need to be a way to combine this with other player's
  los, but it would put all of this work onto the graphics card and it would look a lot
  cleaner.


Theoretically fixed, still need verification:
- Change how sys.Think() works on windows to avoid the need for two branches.
  Glop was changed to make sys.Think() run its logic on the render thread when
  on windows, hopefully that eliminates the need to do anything weird in magnus.
