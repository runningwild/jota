- MAJOR REORG
-- Move local stuff into the game state itself under un-exported variables.  This should make lots of things a lot easier.
-- Rethink abilities a bit - maybe they can be easier to use.
-- Anything that renders based on the side should just render based on Gid.
-- Rethink Gids, they are super-annoying.

- Fix shaders on ATI cards.
- Controller support on windows and linux.
- Allow local movement for better user experience.
- Emailing bug reports should just be handled by a single service, no emails
  required, except maybe to report previously unseen crashes.
- Simple AIs are in, give them a way to randomly use abilities.
- Once glop stuff is all stubbed out make a server binary that can be run anywhere.
- Instead of shadows being black they should show a greyed out version of the map, with no entities.

Theoretically fixed, still need verification:
- Change how sys.Think() works on windows to avoid the need for two branches.
  Glop was changed to make sys.Think() run its logic on the render thread when
  on windows, hopefully that eliminates the need to do anything weird in jota.

Fixed:
- Make the los cache an lru cache to reduce memory usage. <- This was fixed by
  just doing the los texture different, basically just on the graphics card.
- The vast majority of cpu time is spent doing los calculations.  Consider rendering
  the los texture as infinitely tall columns from a viewpoint that looks directly down
  onto the player.  There would need to be a way to combine this with other player's
  los, but it would put all of this work onto the graphics card and it would look a lot cleaner.
